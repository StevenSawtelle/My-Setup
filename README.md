# My-Setup

Got tired of setting up new environments when I switched internships, went home, got a new computer. Until I find a better way, this repo will serve as my way of doing two things:

- Making setup on new machines less painful and more consistent
- Hopefully show other neat things they can incorporate into their workflow

Please feel free to pull request if you have something you think could make my life easier :), or maybe fork for your own use if yours is dramatically different.
